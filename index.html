                    Hello and welcome to my personal page!
                </p>
                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm Matti, currently pursuing my M.Sc. in Computer Science at TU Berlin.
                    My main interests are in cybersecurity (mostly hardware and embedded systems security), microarchitecture design, and low-level programming.
                    Outside of university, I enjoy weightlifting (not the Olympic kind) as well as some of my other constantly rotating interests (e.g., shaving soaps).
                </p>
                <h2>My "career" so far</h2>
                <p>
                    I completed my Abitur in 2021, with the german grade of 1.6, after which I started my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at TU Berlin.
                    During my Bachelor's, I spent one year working part-time each as a systems administrator for Cronon GmbH and a software developer for Codewerk GmbH.
                    Through these jobs, I gained notable insights into how professional software is developed and how large software systems are operated.
                    I finished my Bachelor's in 2025, with the german grade of 1.6, writing my thesis on attacking the RPMC security feature of modern SPI flash chips, through voltage-glitching and other hardware attacks.
